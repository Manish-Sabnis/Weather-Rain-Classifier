# Real-Time Weather Rain Classifier

Predict rain in real-time using weather data from free APIs. This project includes a trained ML model, an interactive Streamlit dashboard, and automated workflows using GitHub Actions.

## ðŸš€ Demo
ðŸ”— [Live Streamlit App](https://weather-rain-classifier-fa55ivjbi3nxuzs5lurn8q.streamlit.app/)

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Real-time weather data fetched via Meteostat API
- Binary classification: Rain or No Rain
- Trained using Random Forest on features like temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, etc.
- Automated hourly predictions using GitHub Actions
- Weekly retraining pipeline
- Streamlit dashboard for visualization

---

## ðŸ“Š Model Workflow

### Training (`train_rain_model.py`)
- Uses historical weather data
- Extracts relevant features
- Trains a `RandomForestClassifier`
- Saves the model as `model.pkl`

### Prediction (`predict_rain.py`)
- Runs every hour (via GitHub Actions)
- Fetches the most recent weather data
- Loads trained model
- Makes prediction â†’ logs/stores result

## ðŸ”„ Automation with GitHub Actions

### `predict.yml`
- Runs **hourly**
- Executes `predict_rain.py`
- Makes live predictions with the latest data

### `train.yml`
- Runs **weekly (Monday @ 00:00)**
- Fetches past data, trains a new model
- Replaces the old model in the repo

## ðŸ“¦ Setup Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Weather-Rain-Classifier.git
cd Weather-Rain-Classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
